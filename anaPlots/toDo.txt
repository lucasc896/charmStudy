- change the way histogram options are handled
    - potentially use a dictionary function at the val for each histogram key
- add in xSec re-weighting - note: model dependant
- add in different switches for bTagEff and anaPlots
- write code for bTagEff
    - make stand-alone from makeAnaPlots.py
- put color definitions matched to a signal sample
   - only need to define inside comparPlots - can be a one line thing
- synchronise histNames and root file structure with Z
